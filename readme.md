# blog

This project is currently under development and is *not* complete in any sense of the word. 

This project is intended to be a minimal blog engine focused on ease of use and performance, using the latest in .NET technologies. The initial MVP will consist of a Razor Pages implementation using EF Core 2 for the data persistence layer.
